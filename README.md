# Elm SPA Playground
Playing around with Elm SPAs and structuring them for larger scale applications.

#### Getting Started
Everything is set up in package.json, meaning you just have to run,

```bash
$ npm i
```

- `npm run dev` starts a local development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` builds a production optimized file in dist/elm.min.js with a sourcemap
- `npm run test:verify` runs the Elm doc/examples tests
- `npm run test` and `npm run test:watch` runs unit tests, with the latter running in watch mode

### Environment Variables

Docs coming...

- `.env` / `.env.development`
- `index.unprocessed.html`

### ðŸš§ I18n Support

Docs coming...

- `Core.I18n`
- `index.unprocessed.html`

### ðŸš§ GraphQL

### ðŸš§ Material-UI

### Unit Tests
We use [elm-test](https://github.com/elm-community/elm-test) to run our unit tests, in the `tests/` folder.

Run `npx elm-test` to run the tests-

### Verified Examples in Documentation
We use [elm-verify-examples](https://github.com/stoeffel/elm-verify-examples) to ensure that code in documentation is kept up-to-date. This is similar to tools liek doc-tests in other languages.

A brief example, that'll be validated.

```elm
1+1 --> 2
```

Running `npm run test:verify` (or `npx elm-verify-examples --run-tests`) will both generate and validate these docs. Make sure you have added the fils to check in `tests/elm-verify-examples.json`.

### CI
We use Github actions to build the project, run tests, and run doc tests in the CI pipeline. Check out the workflows in `.github/workflows/` to see the specific workflows that are set up.
